This contains 3 Files:

> Basic Chat Client - tries to connect to the host IP address set. This has basic functions and can send messages accross the network.

> Basic Chat Server - Looks for any incomming connections to the local host. Is also able to send and recieve messages.

> Full Client Server Chat - Mix of both Client & Server. Has the option to connect or await a connection from and to a target host.

Still work in progress - Only one message can be sent at a time until the other machine sends a reply.
